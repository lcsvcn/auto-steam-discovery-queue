Farm Cards From Discovery Key

Copy and Add This to Tampermonkey

What it does?

It farm all cards from your discovery key without any interaction.

It runs 4ever?

No, the script is smart enought to know when there is no more cards cards drops this day. 
And set a auto-reload for 12h after the script stopped, in case you left it for more than a day.

Where it works?
It`s fully working at Steam Discovery Queue in 2018.

It will work 4 ever on Steam Discovery Queue?
It will work 4 ever, as long as the steam site is not changed. In case of any alteration of the css in this pages, 
it might not work anymore, but probably I will made a new one that works.

IF it is not working anymore or you find any bugs on the script send an e-mail for me at lcs.vcn@gmail.com 
with the tag  [auto-steam-discovery-queue] at subject field. Thanks. :)
